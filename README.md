## Summary

This is my second project using just HTML and CSS. The main components are a background covering a majority of the screen, a title and a form with multiple inputs.

After my review, my main take-away is that I need to use CSS Flexbox more, because it will allow me to control the design a bit more easily.

The fonts are not ideal with the contrast, so putting a background banner behind may help ease that, but I don't want to hide the beautiful imagery! Haha...
